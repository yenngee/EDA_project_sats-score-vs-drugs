## EDA Project: Analysis on Sat Scores and Drug Usage

### Note (25-Aug-18): 
- This was the second project just 3-4 weeks into General Assembly course. 
- Testing on exploratary data analysis 
- The project were guided questions which broke one big problem into smaller once 
- I kept the code as it was since I submitted it on 18-Jun-18

my reflection: EDA was really interesting, and we can obtain a lot of insights just by looking at the data alone without any modelling. 

### Question: 
The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state, and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!

This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Failure to perform EDA before modeling is almost guaranteed to lead to bad models and faulty conclusions.
